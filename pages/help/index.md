# About Help Pages

CodeNotary Ledger Compliance® (CLC) is a light-weight, high-performance ledger platform. It provides two points of user access -- a browser-based UI (the CLC UI) for creation and management of ledgers, and a straightforward SDK that allows your applications to write immutable, cryptographically verifiable transactions to your ledgers.

These help pages address the process of creating and managing ledgers in the CLC web-UI, as well as the use of our SDK to write and query ledger entries from your code.  

The procedures for both configuration and use (through the SDK) are identical whether your instance is deployed in the cloud or on premises.
