CodeNotary Ledger Compliance is a high-performance solution that provides an auditable, immutable, and cryptographically verifiable transaction ledger system.
Ledger Compliance can be used to record every single system or application data change in tamperproof databases. That allows to maintain a complete and verifiable change history over time, that is always accessible and can be verified by any client or SDK.

Ledgers are well known to record the history of financial data, but there is so much more data being produced inside an organization that needs to be stored immutably. 

* store every update to sensitive database fields (credit card or bank account data) of an existing application database
* CI/CD recipes to protect build and deployment pipelines
* invoices and documents
* digital certificates 
* digital objects identification (digital checksum)
* store log streams (i. e. access logs)

CodeNotary Ledger Compliance upgrades your overall digital security and enables you to stay compliant with many regulations, i. e. PCI-DSS-10.
