It's important to create audit reports from time to time to prove that the data within a Ledger has not been tampered and is stored secure and verifiable.
CodeNotary Ledger Compliance offers the audit report functionality individually for each Ledger (main menu: Ledgers) or in the main menu **Audit Report** as a central function.
