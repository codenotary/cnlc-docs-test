## Creating new users

To add a user to the system, you'll need their email address, desired user name, their role in the system and, optionally, their first and last name.

### Role-based permissions

Note that some limitations to user administration are imposed by your assign role.

Admin  - Limited read-write access to all functions in the UI.

Ledger manager  - Read-write access to user functions in the UI, but no access to admin functions.
