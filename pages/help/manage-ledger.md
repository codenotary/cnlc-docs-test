The Ledgers page lists all the ledgers currently defined in the appliance, along with usage information.
By clicking on the Actions button, a privileged user can disable a Ledger, i.e. making it not available for data
insertion.

The user can navigate in the Ledger Dashboard by clicking on a ledger name.

## Ledger dashboard

The Ledger dashboard lists shows insights and details about the current ledger.

1. The Ledger switcher allows to switch from one ledger to another quickly.
2. Tampering alerts and messages show if the ledger has been tampered with or if there any diagnostic messages
related to the current ledger. A click on the messages box will lead the user to the
[Messages and Notifications](/help/messages) tab.
3. Writes over time shows write operations in the current ledger during the last 6 hours.

Other Ledger statistics are shown in the page, such as the number of Ledger entries, Ledger size on disk, last
data insertion time and the number of active data sources.

## API Keys

The API Keys tab allows the user to add and manage a Ledger's API Keys.
For each API key available on a ledger, its name, type (SDK, CI/CD, Postgres), last usage is displayed.

By clicking on "Actions", it's possible to delete an API key, retrieve its value or show the Signer ID (in case
of CI/CD keys).

**Caution**: deleting an API Key will prevent applications using it to write data in the respective ledgers.

It is possible to create a new API key by clicking on "Create API Key" and providing an API Key name.

*We recommend to avoid special characters for API Key name.*
